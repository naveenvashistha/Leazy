A fully responsive single page web application made with MERN stack.
Ever wondered how irritating that is to stop the fun movie you are
watching and then go to google to see the word you don't understand in
subtitles?
Leazy solves that problem at its heart. You just need to select the word
you don't understand and its meaning will pop up without you having to
go to another screen. No fun pause was the idea behind this.
You can also download subtitle of the movie you want to watch and use it
directly without unzipping it.
You can put movie request and the link will be updated in the website
from where you can watch the movie with just one click and no ad.
